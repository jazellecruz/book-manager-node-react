# Booked - Personal Book Manager Web App 

Booked is a simple and basic personal book manager built with NodeJS, ReactJS, and MySQL. 

## Note! Note! Note!
This repository was originally the repository for the frontend of the web app, which makes requests to a separate server that handles the data. I carelessly finished this project and deployed it despite it being disorganized. But upon reading my code recently, I have realized that I made the project unnecessarily complex and unreadable :'). It took me days to understand how my OWN project works. After reading the horrid code, I ditched the plan of adding a new feature and decided to refactor it instead. I refactored and refactored and refactored my code. Finally, after hours of planning, research, and refactoring, I have now successfully dumbed down my project to its simplest form that can be understandable, maintainable, and readable (even to my noob self). The project has still a long way to go, but is now better than it was before.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository on your local machine.

```bash
git clone jazellecruz/book-manager-node-react
``` 

2. Go to the project directory

3. Once you're in the directory, go to the server folder. Install the dependencies.

```bash
npm install 
``` 

4. Start the server.

```bash
nodemon server.js
``` 

5. In a new terminal tab, go to the client directory of the project. Just like step 4 and 5, install the dependencies then start the react app.

```bash
npm start
``` 

6. Enjoy ðŸ˜‰

## Improvements To Be Added In The Future
- Add a feature that sorts/filters books by category, status, and title.
- Better error-handling in the server-side.
- CSS :')
- Eliminate prop drilling of functions.
- Maybe deploy????
